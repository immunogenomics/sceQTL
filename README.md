# Single-cell eQTL analysis of memory T cells

## Overview
This repo provides code used for single-cell eQTL analysis of single-cell CITE-seq data from 500,089 memory T cells. If you are interested in code for any additional analyses from our study, please contact us at aparnanathan@g.harvard.edu

This study is available as a preprint:

## Data availability

Single-cell data are availale on GEO (Accession: GSE158769) and can be interactively browsed on [our website](https://immunogenomics.io/tbru/).
Genotyping data are available on dbGaP (Accession: phs002025).

Please send any questions regarding the study, data, or analyses to Aparna Nathan (aparnanathan@g.harvard.edu).
